# Green software engineering?
### Introduction
This podcast discusses about the Green software engineering also called as sustainable software engineering, This podcast didn't discuss the issues related to green cloud, but they have discussed the things at software development level.
They discussed things like
- how to write the code?
- how to measure our code?
- how we tets our code? to achieve the sustainable goals and reduce energy consumption.

The speakers also argued that reducing the energy consumption will the reduce the cost and also said that increase in battery life in sensors devices, mobiles can also reduce the enerfy consumptions.

The speakers also expressed there is no accurate tool to measure the enry consumption, but they also told that there are certain practices that can be follwed by the developer to make them energy efficient.

##### Practices and Factors that can make software efficient

- The energy consumption of software can depend on the type of hardware used.
- It can also depend on the choice of cloud choosed a
- Languages and freameworks used like c,C++ and rust are fast so they ars enery efficient, the use of programming language also plays a major role in energy cinsumpyion.
- The design pattern that have been used for developing the software like the decarator pattern is very energy efficient due its architecture.

The speakers also addressed the impotanance and future possibilities of sustainable software engineering.
