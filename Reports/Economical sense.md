# Does it make economical sense to consider the carbon footprint when working on a software project?

- Yes, I think its good to consider the economical sense, because it has many advantages and benefits.

- The consideration of carbon footprint is economical as it can save money, if the softwares developed are energy efficient, then the energy consumption is less ,which leads to save the  money, so the green softwares have an financial edge over the regular softwares.

- The consideration of carbon footprint can be used as marketing strategy, as the people, firms and countries( zero emissions) are moving towards the use of products that have less environmental impact, this would attract the entities to use the software that have less carbon foot print.

- The governments are providing the huge tax incentives to companies thet develop the green software as they are moving to avoid the carbon emissions, the companies can save their money by adopting the policies developed by governments that can give the finalncial edge to companies.
