## Screenshots of Cloud Carbon Footprint in an ephemeral workspace:
![screenshot 1](https://github.com/OU-CS5213/CS5213-Summer23-Project7/assets/113566461/e86163c8-076f-419f-8c84-f9abc46522d1)
The above screenshot shows the Cloud Carbon Footprint cloud usage graph. It provides helpful insights into the environmental impact of cloud computing in terms of CO2 emissions, kilowatt hours(kWh) of energy consumed and it's costs. Organizations can use this graph to see how the use of cloud resources affects their carbon footprint and make informed decisions that take into account both economic effectiveness and environmental sustainability.Users can follow changes in cloud usage over time and learn how it links to CO2 emissions by keeping an eye on the graph. Organizations(AWS, Azure, GCP) can evaluate the energy efficiency of their cloud operations by using the graph's information on kWh of energy consumed. As the graph is generated on monthly basis, Companies can cut CO2 emissions, lower energy usage, and possibly reduce costs by analyzing the data to find regions of excessive resource consumption and improve their cloud infrastructure. This encourages smart cloud usage while pursuing both financial and environmental sustainability.

Based on the EPA Equivalencies Calculator (Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator), the left side of the screenshot displays the total CO2 emissions in metric tons, which we may compare to the number of flights that can travel from NYC and London, phones, or trees.
The screenshot's right side displays carbon intensity based on different regions, services, or accounts. us-east1 (GCP) has a high carbon intensity for the areas at 25.62%. In the event that the service was chosen, computeEngine (GCP) has a high carbon emission rate of 26.92%. AWS account 3 (AWS) has the highest emission overall with 20.30%.

![Carbon Intensity Map](https://github.com/OU-CS5213/CS5213-Summer23-Project7/assets/113566461/d51d57a5-7334-4fdf-8257-42bfb9bc5916)
The global use of carbon in different regions is depicted on the carbon intensity map above. Intensities are represented by various colors. There is a specified value range for each color. Low intensity is represented by green, and high intensity is represented by brown. While ap-south-1, ap-east-1, af-south-1, ap-southeast-3, and ap-southeast-2 have high intensity, eu-north-1, eu-west-3, sa-east-1, and ca-central-1 have low intensity.
